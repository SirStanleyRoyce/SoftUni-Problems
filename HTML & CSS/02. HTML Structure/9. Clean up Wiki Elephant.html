	Large
	terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia

	This article is about a paraphyletic
	group. For close extinct relatives, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a>. For
	other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_(disambiguation)">Elephant (disambiguation)</a>.

	<p><b>Elephants</b> are the largest existing land animals. Three living <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species">species</a> are currently
		recognised: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a>, the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant">African forest elephant</a>, and the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant">Asian
			elephant</a>. They are an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly">informal grouping</a> within the
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)">family</a> <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> of
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)">order</a> <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>.
		Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon">mastodons</a>. Elephantidae
		also contains several extinct groups, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth">mammoths</a>
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-tusked_elephant">straight-tusked elephants</a>. <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant">African
			elephants</a> have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears,
		and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis">proboscis</a> called a
		trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for
		breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived
		from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The
		large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column">pillar</a>-like legs carry
		their great weight.
	</p>
	<p>Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa">sub-Saharan
			Africa</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast
			Asia</a> and are found in different habitats, including <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests,
		deserts, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh">marshes</a>. They are <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivorous">herbivorous</a>, and they stay near water when it is
		accessible. They
		are considered to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species">keystone species</a>, due to their
		impact on their environments.
		Elephants have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society">fissionâ€“fusion
			society</a>, in which multiple family groups
		come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of
		one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not
		include bulls, are usually led by the oldest cow, known as the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other
		males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a
		state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone">testosterone</a> and aggression known as
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)">dominance</a> over other males as well as
		reproductive success.
		Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long
		as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_communication">communicate</a> by touch, sight, smell, and
		sound; elephants
		use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication">seismic communication</a> over long distances. <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition">Elephant
			intelligence</a> has been compared with that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate">primates</a>
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea">cetaceans</a>. They appear to
		have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness">self-awareness</a>, and appear to show <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a> for dying and dead
		family members.

	<p>African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species">endangered</a> and African forest elephants as <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered">critically endangered</a> by the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for
			Conservation
			of Nature</a> (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_trade">ivory trade</a>, as the
		animals are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching">poached</a> for
		their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction">habitat
			destruction</a> and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal">working
			animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
		controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus">circuses</a>. Elephants are
		highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a
