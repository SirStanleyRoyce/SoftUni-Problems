                </p>
                <p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a 
                        >Neolithic</a> <a 
                        >Karanovo culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to
                    3rd century BC the region was a battleground for ancient <a 
                        >Thracians</a>, <a >Persians</a>, <a
                        >Celts</a> and <a 
                        >Macedonians</a>; stability came when the <a
                        >Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD
                    45. After the Roman state splintered, tribal invasions in the region resumed. Around the 6th
                    century, these territories were settled by the <a >early
                        Slavs</a>. <a >Bulgars</a>, a
                    semi-nomadic people, invaded the Balkans in the late 7th century and founded the <a
                        >First Bulgarian
                        Empire</a> in AD 681. It dominated most of the <a 
                        >Balkans</a> and significantly influenced <a 
                        >Slavic</a> cultures by developing the <a 
                        >Cyrillic script</a>. The First Bulgarian Empire lasted until the
                    early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor <a >Basil
                        II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A <a 
                        >successful Bulgarian revolt</a> in 1185 established a <a
                        >Second Bulgarian
                        Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a >Ivan Asen
                        II</a> (1218–1241). After
                    numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the empire disintegrated in 1396 and fell under <a
                        >Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five
                    centuries.
                </p>
                <p>The <a 
                        >Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a> resulted in the
                    formation of the third and current Bulgarian state. Many ethnic Bulgarians were left outside the
                    new nation's borders, which stoked <a >irredentist</a>
                    sentiments that led to several conflicts with its
                    neighbours and alliances with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria came under the
                    Soviet-led <a >Eastern Bloc</a> and became a <a
                        >one-party
                        socialist state</a>. The ruling <a 
                        >Communist Party</a>
                    gave up its monopoly on power after the <a 
                        >revolutions of 1989</a> and allowed <a
                        >multiparty</a> elections.
                    Bulgaria then transitioned into a <a >democracy</a> and
                    a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, Bulgaria has been a <a
                        >unitary</a> <a
                        >parliamentary
                        republic</a> composed of 28 provinces, with a high degree of political, administrative, and
                    economic centralisation.
                </p>
                <p>Bulgaria is a <a >developing
                        country</a>, with an <a 
                        >upper-middle-income economy</a>, ranking 56th in the <a
                        >Human Development
                        Index</a>. Its <a >market economy</a> is
                    part of the <a >European
                        Single Market</a> and is largely based on services, followed by industry—especially machine
                    building and mining—and agriculture. <a 
                        >Widespread corruption</a> is a major socioeconomic issue;
                    Bulgaria ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.&#91;9&#93;</a>
                    The country also faces a
                    demographic crisis, with its population shrinking annually since around 1990; it currently
                    numbers roughly seven million, down from a peak of nearly nine million in 1988. Bulgaria is a
                    member of the <a >European Union</a>, <a
                        >NATO</a>, the <a 
                        >Council of Europe</a>; it is also a founding member of the <a
                        
                        >OSCE</a>, and has taken a seat
                    on the <a 
                        >United Nations Security Council</a> three times.
